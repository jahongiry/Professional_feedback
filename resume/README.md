# Resume
**Create the first draft of your resume**

__Description__ <br/>
In this project, we'll be walking you step by step through the process of building a resume designed to highlight your achievements and catch a hiring manager's eye. This will be your first draft, so don't worry about getting it perfect this round. Get your first draft out there, and then you will get feedback you can use to improve it. <br/> <br/>
__Why is a strong resume so important?__<br/>
Your resume is arguably the most important project you'll work on during Professional Skills. Every time you submit a job application, the first thing a hiring manager looks at will likely be your resume; in other words, for most applicants, the resume is your one chance at a first impression. Your resume is going to be the main reason whether you get invited to interviews or you don't. Unfortunately, most resumes are badly written, and most resumes therefore automatically end up in the "rejection" pile. This project will walk you through how to write a resume designed to attract a hiring manager's attention, even if you don't have prior software development work experience.
__Start__ <br/>
- Choose one of the ATS-compatible and content-efficient resume templates below. You will be able to make changes to these resumes, such as by choosing new fonts and colors or by reorganizing sections as needed, but you must choose one of these templates. Note: you do not have Edit access to these files. You will need to make a copy to your own Google Drive so you can edit your own resume.<br/>
[Template 1:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isShs6xwmLqRoBjsmDgMq1SBXkvd0GcKSOwpI4rAboE/edit) Traditional, corporate. Single column. Good for students with minimal experience.<br/>
[Template 2:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iz_P3dBX787ABfm_r7I9xR8bQa5Wb8hlRkHUiwI_VAg/edit) Modern, easy to read. Single column. Good for students with minimal experience.<br/>
[Template 3:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmsNiP_E-NUCPMpw2Tq8U2cxEIeI0JEECnagSEdlkjw/edit) Modern and professional. Single column.<br/>
[Template 4:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kWikoIDAKUK1SBeEctIHVj6zpaVDsDcDzjXGU_JI6fo/edit) Traditional, corporate. Two columns. Inspired by Serif.<br/>
[Template 5:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jMxmTpC1kZT2F6wcyXeM_0NEdhuWbRhYeYUSaP0qNAk/edit) Traditional, corporate, confident. Two columns.<br/><br/>
- Build the resume in Google Docs. This will allow project reviewers to leave comments and suggestions directly on the document. If you would later like to save your document in another file format (such as a .pdf), Google Docs allows you to export files using multiple file formats.
- Share your document so that anyone with the link can make suggestions. If you do not share access to your resume, project reviewers will not have an easy way to provide you with feedback, your resume will be returned to you without edits, and you may be delayed in your progress in the program.
# Maintain grammatical consistency in your resume
Grammatical consistency simply means that if you use one grammatical format for one sentence, you need to use it for all of them. If one bullet point begins with a past-tense verb, then they should all begin with a past-tense verb. We'll take a look at a few ways to demonstrate consistency in your resume.
# Ensure your resume pays attention to spelling, grammar, tense, and clarity 
Proper grammar, spelling, and sentence clarity is essential not only to showing attention to detail, but also to showcasing your English abilities. For that reason, it's important to make use of tools to help you improve these elements of your resume.
